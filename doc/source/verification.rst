Verification
============

The plugin automatically connects Openbook to the OpenStack environment.  To verify correct operation, login 
as administrator to the Openbook dashboard (using :ref:`the node IP <retrieve_ip>`), select 'Service Managers'
under CONFIGURE, right-click the "MOS Environment" service manager, and select 'Edit Service Manager'.  Click
"Test Connection" to see "Authentication Succeeded" message.
