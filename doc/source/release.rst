Release Notes
=============

The release of Openbook v3 is based on several months of close interaction and detailed feedback from operators of large scale private and public clouds based on OpenStack and VMware. The refined feature set available in v3 includes:

* Clear reports of utilization and growth trends at the cloud provider, business unit, cost center, and tenant level for capacity and budget planning.

* A VMware adapter to support hybrid cloud environments and provide costs comparisons of workloads running in VMware or OpenStack instances. Azure support is coming soon.

* Enhanced chargeback and showback reporting that rolls up multiple tenants to a single cost center, while also providing ad hoc drill down of the detail resource consumption and associated costs.

* The ability to include non-OpenStack infrastructure elements, custom metrics, or services into rates plans and billing models via API or user-defined fields.
